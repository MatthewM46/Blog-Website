Posts and Moderation Service
============================

Our microservice is to provide the functionality of posting, interacting with
posts, and moderating these posts. This process requires multiple different
versions of posts with different qualities to deal with things like removing the
post or hiding it from the public. To solve this problem we decided that the bes
way to do it was by implementing a combination of the state and decorator design
patterns.
