Microservices Breakdown
=======================

This is a breakdown of the microservices that make up the application. Documentation
for each service is available in its respective directory. We have decided in this preliminary
stage that each group will implement their service using Java with Spring Boot, as this is
what everyone is most comfortable with. This may change in the future.

üìå **Please Note**: Sequence diagrams can be viewed by navigating to individual usecases using the
links provided here.
